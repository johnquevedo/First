      <h2>Message from the Founder</h2>
        <div class="founder-message">
          <p>As a proud individual of Peruvian descent, the Society for Hispanics in STEM holds a deeply personal significance for me. Amidst the challenging times of quarantine in 2020, I found a profound calling to create a space where Hispanic individuals passionate about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics could find support, guidance, and inspiration. The idea stemmed from my own journey navigating the STEM field, feeling the lack of representation and resources specific to the Hispanic community. I envisioned a platform not just for academic pursuits but also for fostering a sense of belonging and empowerment. Our goal is not only to offer educational resources but also to cultivate a vibrant community that celebrates diversity and excellence. I strongly believe that diverse perspectives are key to innovation and progress in STEM. Thank you for being part of this incredible journey towards creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for Hispanics in STEM. Together, let us strive to build a future where everyone, regardless of background, can thrive and contribute to the ever-evolving landscape of science and technology.</p>
